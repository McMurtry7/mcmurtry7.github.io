I'm seriously out of my league here. But I'm going to give it a shot anyway.

I want to go from typing CSS and HTML (like what I do at my web design job), to actually using workflow tools to build sites. Considering I have a Fine Arts degree and not a Computer Science degree I think it's going to be a bit of a challenge. But I'll get there.

I'm currently interested in things like Gulp, Bower, Jekyll (might have noticed that's what this site is built with), and SASS. We'll see how I go from there.

This site is built using Jekyll but I haven't got Jekyll running inside Gulp which would probably be my next step (I MISS BROWSER SYNC ALREADY SO BAD).

Who nows how long I'm going to keep up this blogging business but I imagine it'll be a mix of web dev stuff, D&D stories, and car related stories. So just a real mismash of whatever the fuck. Sounds like a treat right?
